## Python

### :point_right: Prerequisites

1. #### Configure Alibaba Cloud API-KEY

    Before running this example, you need to create an Alibaba Cloud account, obtain the API-KEY, and complete environment configuration. For detailed API-KEY configuration steps, please refer to: [PREREQUISITES.md](../../../../PREREQUISITES.md)

1. #### Install ffmpeg

    This example requires ffmpeg for audio/video decoding. It is recommended to download and install it from the official website, and configure the ffmpeg installation path in the environment variables: [ffmpeg official website download](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). You can also refer to the document [How to install ffmpeg](../../../docs/QA/ffmpeg_en.md).

1. #### Install Python dependencies

    The Alibaba Cloud SDK requires Python 3.8 or higher. You can use the following command to install dependencies for this example:
    ```commandline
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Please refer to [documentation](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) for ffmpeg installation

### :point_right: How to Run the Example
You can use the following command to run this example:

```commandline
python3 run.py
```
When the example runs, it will call the Alibaba Cloud Qwen (qwen-turbo) large language model to answer the question: "How to cook tomatoes with eggs?" and use the longhua_v2 voice to send the model's response text in streaming mode for synthesis, then stream and play the audio through the speaker.

Sample output:
```
>>> Question: How to cook tomatoes with eggs?
>>> Answer: It's quite simple to make tomatoes with eggs. First prepare the ingredients: several fresh tomatoes and eggs. Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a little salt, then stir well with a chopstick.
Next, heat the pan with oil, when the oil is hot enough, pour in the egg liquid. Once it starts to solidify, flip it with a spatula a few times. When the eggs turn golden yellow, remove them and set aside.

Add more oil to the pan, put in the chopped tomatoes and stir-fry. As the tomatoes release some juice, you can add a bit of sugar to balance the sour taste according to your preference. When the tomatoes are almost done, add the previously cooked
eggs back in to stir-fry together. Finally, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed, sprinkle some green onions, and it's ready to serve!

Give it a try, and remember to pay attention to the heat!                                                                                              synthesize and play over with requestId:  09690564096a47a5b7fae07dbb615117
```

You can modify `query_to_llm` to change the question content.
